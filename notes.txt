ORION-LD
    - For now, Orion-LD only runs under Linux. 
    No effort has been made so far to make Orion-LD run under any other platform. 
    The obvious choice would be MacOS, and if anybody volunteers to investigate on this, 
    it would be a very welcome contribution.

    - According to the FIWARE Data Modelling Guidelines on linked data, when an entity attribute 
    is used as a link to other entities it should be named with the prefix ref plus the name of 
    the target (linked) entity type.
